This is a live copy of the original SAMMwise code repository, currently archived under the owaspsamm organization.

It is not intended that we continue development on this code base. Rather we'll be creating a new 'SAMMwise' 
primary code base folder, where we'll get started on development of a "ready for primetime" Version 1.0 tool.
